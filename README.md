# Budgeting Calculator
This webpage is built for those who struggle to budget for themselves.
The webpage allows people to input how much they make in a month and give a break down as to how much of their monthly wages goes into bills and rent/mortgage.
It will also help in giving a amount of time and money required for a vacation if they so desire.
In the process of developing this page it became apparent that it is important to start small and build as you are able. We wanted to add many features which we did not have the time to do.

## Usage
When you open the webpage you can enter information about your budget. The webpage will return your information on the next page.
