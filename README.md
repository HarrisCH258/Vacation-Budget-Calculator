# Budgeting Calculator
This webpage is built for those who struggle to budget for themselves.
The webpage allows people to input how much they make in a month and give a breakdown as to how much of their monthly wages goes into bills and rent/mortgage.
It can also help with your personal vacation plans if you are unsure if your timeline is affordable or possible.

## Usage
Once the webpage is opened you will be instructed to fill out your information and click submit. 
The "Submit" then activates a modal that that asks you to double check your information to make sure its accurate.
When the modal is confirmed it will push you to a new page called "Profile".
The "Profile" page will give you a simple financial breakdown and another set of instructions to for you to follow if you'd like to find out if a vacation is feasible.
Once the vacation form is filled out you can click "submit" and the webpage will give yu a small set of different responses.
